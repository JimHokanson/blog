My name is James (Jim) Hokanson. I'm currently a postdoc in biomedical engineering at Duke University working with Dr. Warren Grill on urological dysfunction.

In my free time I like programming, reading books, and running, although with 3 kids and a hectic work schedule it has been tough to find free time lately.
