# Blog Version 3 #

After giving Github Pages a try I've decided to host my blog directly on Github.

My first science-y blog was using Google's Blogger. The interface was relatively straightforward to use but I started to wonder what would happen when Google decided to GChat Blogger into oblivion. 

In an attempt to be a bit cooler I decided to give Github Pages a try. I was quite surprised at how hard it was to use. Really, I just wanted a place to write without spending too much time fiddling with things. After several months of not writing because I dreaded trying to figure out how to make things look reasonable, I decided I needed a different approach.

So now I'm trying blogging directly on Github. I think this approach is a bit unconventional but I'm excited to start writing again!
