**July 2018 - "Porting" a Simple Matlab Program for Octave** 

[article link](2018_07_Matlab_to_Octave/readme.md)

This post briefly describes my experience porting a Matlab program to Octave. There were many changes that needed to be made but nothing that was so onerous as to warrant rewriting using a different language.

**January 2018 - Speeding up Matlab Line Plotting**

[article link](2018_01_PlotBig_Matlab/readme.md)

Ever try plotting 20 minutes of data sampled at 20 kHz in Matlab? It's not a lot of fun. I wrote a bit of code to make plotting of line plots in Matlab much faster. Working out the SIMD intrinsics for this project was a challenge but was fun to get working.

**January 2018 - Writing a performant JSON parser in Matlab to facilitate scientific data exchange** 

[article link](2018_01_Turtle_JSON_Intro/readme.md)

This post introduces a JSON parser I wrote for speeding up parsing of JSON in Matlab. This post focuses on the C code I wrote to do the majority of the parsing work. It focuses on techniques I used to make the parsing as fast as possible.
