I have a new blog post about writing a SAS parser for MATLAB. I also recently wrote about the development of code to read LabChart files into MATLAB (and Python). Check them out [here](blog).

# About Me #

<img src="jim_photo.jpg" alt="Photo of Jim" height="300">

My name is James (Jim) Hokanson. I am an assistant professor in a joint department of biomedical engineering between the [Medical College of Wisconsin and Marquette University](https://mcw.marquette.edu/biomedical-engineering/). My background is in neural engineering (see below). I'm interested in developing new therapies to treat urological dysfunction, particularly urgency urinary incontinence. I'm also interested in developing new diagnostic tests to improve the therapy selection process as well as to inform new therapy development, using machine learning/data driven approaches to create new insights. My skillset includes electrical stimulation, physiological testing, software development and machine learning. My work includes a mixture of both clinical and pre-clinical studies. I'm passionate about improving women's pelvic health 

## Background ##

My previous job was as an research scientist in biomedical engineering at Duke University working with [Drs. Warren Grill (PhD)](https://bme.duke.edu/faculty/warren-grill) and [Cindy Amundsen (MD)](https://obgyn.duke.edu/about/our-faculty/cindy-louise-amundsen-md) on treatments for urological dysfunction. You can find out more about that research on my [research page](research).

As an undergraduate at Washington University in St. Louis I worked in [Dr. Dan Moran's](https://engineering.wustl.edu/Profiles/Pages/Daniel-Moran.aspx) lab where I conducted electrocorticography (ECoG) research. The ultimate goal of that work is to allow individuals with paralysis or neuromuscular disorders to control devices by extracting motor intent signals directly from the brain (using ECoG recordings).

I did my graduate work at the University of Pittsburgh with [Dr. Doug Weber](http://www.rnel.pitt.edu/people/douglas-j-weber-phd). My focus was on developing an animal model to study artificial somatosensory feedback via electrical stimulation of dorsal root ganglia. The ultimate goal of that work is to develop a prosthetic that not only allows the user to move/control the prosthetic, but that also provides somatosensory feedback.
