# From the Brain to the Bladder #

The goal of my writing is largely to disseminate things that I've made or learned that I've found interesting. Today instead is a bit more of a diary entry documenting my experience as an undergrad and graduate student. Although this post is personal it may provide an interesting perspective for those in a similar situation.

# Getting to College #

I originally was going to jump right into my college years but really my journey in college was influenced by the years preceding college. Arguably much of who I am was shaped at a very young age, but to keep things short I've just noted some things about my time in high school.

Growing up I always enjoyed puzzles and I was pretty good at math. At my high school really advanced math students, those that had taken both algebra and geometry in grade school, took pre-calculus freshman year, calculus sophomore year, and then advanced math courses at Marquette University (just down the road) junior and senior years. I think that applied to only 2 or 3 people in my class of roughly 250. My grade school did not offer geometry, which meant that I was in the semi-advanced group. For this group of roughly 20 that meant that freshman year math involved taking probability and statistics with Mr. Griesbach (our eventual BC calculus teacher) while waiting to take geometry sophomore year with everyone else. 

That course was many years ago, so I don't remember a ton of the details, but I remember it as challenging and enjoying. I remember learning about the birthday problem and the use of Pascal's triangle to figure out how many ways the Milwaukee Bucks could win a certain number of their games. Mr. Griesbach also had a habit of mentioning something to the effect that he would teach us how to solve a problem so that we wouldn't stay up all night thinking about it. This was often said as a joke (I think), and not something I understood at the time, but ultimately a statement that proved to be quite prescient in my future research endeavors.

My science classes weren't as memorable. Although the classes were taught well I wasn't as emotionally drawn into the courses. This relationship of science and math courses would do a 180 in college where the math courses were less exciting for me (Calculus III, Differential Equations, Engineering Math) and the resources of a university made my science classes much more immersive. This held true not only for biology, chemistry, and physics, but also for computer science as well, although for a different reason ....

My high school was quite strong in sports and had good extracurriculars for future lawyers (forensics, model UN, debate). Unfortunately I found it to be a bit lacking in science related extracurriculars. After I left the school started a FIRST robotics team which I was happy to see. Two friends of mine wanted to participate in a science olympiad and I was asked to be the 3rd member of the team, but the whole process was very much ad-hoc. My impression is that the organization of this and related activities has improved since I've left. 

With my strong background in science and math I decided to pursue biomedical engineering in college. The tie-in to medicine made biomedical engineering more appealing than the other engineering disciplines, although I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into. After all, what is (was) biomedical engineering anyway? Interestingly two other friends in my class with similar backgrounds also went to Wash U., where both got business degrees. At the time I couldn't imagine having gone to business school, although business strategy is something that has started creeping into my thoughts lately with respect to commercializing/deploying medical devices.

# Undergraduate at Wash. U. in St. Louis #

I had really hoped to go to MIT for undergrad. Unfortunately the interview portion consisted largely, to my memory, of being asked what math and science competitions I had won (I was 0/1 in all science competitions and had never done a math competition). The interview left me really dejected and I never submitted the second half of my application (the essay portion); not surprisingly I did not get into MIT.

Wash. U. in St. Louis had (has) a really strong medical program and a strong biomedical engineering program which led me to choosing that school. First semester freshman year they offered an introductory BME course where the faculty gave presentations on their research. This is where I was introduced to Dr. Dan Moran, and the field of brain-computer or brain-machine interfaces. The goal of this work is to record activity from the brain that can be used to control a computer or a robot in people that have limited motor function, for example due to a spinal cord injury. Afterwards I asked to work in Dr. Moran's lab and was told that I needed to  TODO TODO TODO TODO

For reasons I can't remember I decided to participate in Engineering Student Council or EnCouncil. As part of EnCouncil I made friends with many junior and senior engineering students.
