Welcome to my page about coding! Note, I don't like people spending time reinventing the same software wheels, instead of getting science done, so I try to provide scientific libraries that will help others bypass the many hours I've spent on code and get right to their science. Feel free to email me if you have any questions about my code.

This page is a work in progress. You can find my code online at:
- GitHub: <https://github.com/jimhokanson>
- Mathworks File Exchange: <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/?term=profileid:937359>
- OpenWorm Analysis Toolbox: <https://github.com/openworm/open-worm-analysis-toolbox>

Scientific Tools:
- [Multichannel Systems Stimulator Matlab Controller](https://github.com/JimHokanson/multichannel_systems_stg_matlab) - code for designing stimulation pulses and controlling the stimulator via Matlab
- [ADInstruments SDK Matlab](https://github.com/JimHokanson/adinstruments_sdk_matlab) - code for reading ADInstruments files into Matlab
- [ADInstruments SDK Python](https://github.com/JimHokanson/adinstruments_sdk_python) - code for reading ADInstruments files into Python
- [Harvard Apparatus Pumps Matlab](https://github.com/JimHokanson/harvard_apparatus_pump_matlab) - code for controlling pumps using Matlab
- [Labchart Server Matlab](https://github.com/JimHokanson/labchart_server_matlab) - code for controlling Labchart via Matlab
- [Jim's Matlab Standard Library](https://github.com/JimHokanson/matlab_standard_library) - contains lots of functions I use when coding in Matlab
- [plotBig Matlab](https://github.com/JimHokanson/plotBig_Matlab) - This code can plot time-series lines very fast. Useful for plotting minutes/hours worth of pressure or EMG signals
- [Turtle JSON](https://github.com/JimHokanson/turtle_json) - Named after my old desktop (RIP), JSON reader specifically written for reading JSON files into MATLAB. "Guaranteed" you will not to find a faster JSON library for MATLAB
- [Matlab TDMS reader](https://github.com/NeuralDataFormats/tdms_matlab_original_version) - reads Labview's TDMS files into Matlab. I have a better one that is slowly in development, (see here)[https://github.com/NeuralDataFormats/matlab_tdms]

There's a lot more out there but these are the most polished libraries.
