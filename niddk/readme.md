Greetings! I hope you find these slides on the neural control of the lower urinary tract useful.

[Slides can be downloaded here](https://mcw.box.com/shared/static/b4noizpry2qtyilzo394qap9og4a1hvg.pptx)

I also went back and recorded my presentation, adding on some additional comments. [You can watch it here](https://mcw.box.com/s/vcwtfyw812e40aj9fohm774482uxmr1c)

The rest of the website is a bit stale but will hopefully get some updates after I get a back log of papers out the door.

Best,\
Jim
